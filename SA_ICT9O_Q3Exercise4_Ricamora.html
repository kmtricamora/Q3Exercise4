	<h3>Baguio</h3>

	<p>Baguio is in Cordillera Administrative Region. It's known as the "Summer Capital" in the Philippines because of its climate. The trip to Baguio took half the day, because I recall waking up at 5 AM just to get ready then arriving there at 5 PM. The place we stayed at everytime we would go to Baguio was a countryclub. I knew it had an expensive fee to get in, but the food in there made-up for it. The view in our hotel room was amazing too, and you didn't even need an aircon because it was already freezing. Some of the places we went to were horse-riding. It was a fun and traumatic experience. I recall the horse having a tantrum. The food was alright, we just ate fast-food places, but I will always remember the taho I ate there, it tasted so good. </p>
	<p>What to do in Baguio: eat, horse-ride, vist churches, buy raisin bread from the country-club (IT TASTES SO GOOD) and many more I probably didn't do because I was tired.</p>
